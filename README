First: selectStations 
Filter for stations with UUB and save in root files.

Second: analyseSDEU
It uses the output root files from selection to get the traces
for all UUB stations.

Third: analyseSDEUbl
It uses the output Root file from analyseSDEU, plotting the
temporal series of: the baseline mean and Rms of the first 100
bins of the traces. The Rms is calculated by the method GetRMS of
TH1F root class, i.e. (1/n)*sum{ (xi - x)^2 }, where x is the
mean. This codes saves these information into histogram and
create a root file for each station.

Fourth: readBl.C
It uses the output Root files from analyseSDEUbl to fit gaussians
to baseline mean and Rms distributions. This information can be
used to filter events with traces out of the mean+-Rms.
